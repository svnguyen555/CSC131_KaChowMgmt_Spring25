# Kachow Management: Car Repair Service Website
A full-stack web application designed to streamline car repair work between customer, mechanics, and admins. This was a class project developed with MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js)

## Overview

The platform allows:
- Customers to create accounts, schedule repair appointments, and view service history.  
- Mechanics to access assigned repair tickets, clock in/out, and manage their workflow.  
- Administrators to oversee the entire process and assign tickets to mechanics.

## My Role

I was responsible for implementing core backend functionality and assisting in frontend-backend integration, including:

- **User Authentication**
  - Enabled password reset functionality with token-based validation.
  - Implemented email notifications for password recovery and appointment confirmations.

- **Customer Features**
  - Allow customers to view their car repair history.
  - Created logic to allow users to modify their account passwords.

- **Backend Support for Frontend Integration**
  - Worked with teammates to connect frontend components to backend APIs.
  - Helped debug appointment creation, ticket assignments, and employee clock-in systems.

## Experiences Gained
 - First time developing a website and using full-stack technology
 - Group collaboration and utilizing git features like pushing and merging

## Future Improvements
The project was unable to be finished in time so there are a couple of features that could be added if this project were to continue.
 - Appointment cancellation handling
 - Appointment reschedule handling
 - Allowing admin to approve mechanic work hours and issuing out an invoice for payment
